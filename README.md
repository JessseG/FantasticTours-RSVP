# FantasticTours-RSVP

This is a reservations page for a Miami tourism company called Fantastic Tours. The way it works is hotel employees make tour reservations for groups of hotel guests. For example, a group of 4 people schedule an Everglades tour for Saturday at 2pm. All the relevant info pertaining to that reservation is then submitted and stored into a MySQL Database. The company then uses that info to pick up the groups at the hotels in order to take them to the everglades park for their scheduled tour. Soon I'll be developing a mobile app that will use the reservation info in their database to automatically generate the company's tour schedule. HTML, CSS, & PHP were used to put the page together.
